    <app-explanation title="Salivary Gland">
      The salivary gland produces saliva, which contains amylase, which breaks
      down carbohydrates into simple sugars.

  <div class="explanations">
    <app-explanation title="Mouth">
      The mouth contains teeth, and uses mechanical digestion to break down food
      into smaller chunks. The tongue (also in the mouth) then pushes the food
      down into the esophagus.
    </app-explanation>
    <app-explanation title="Esophagus">
      The esophagus is the tube that carries food from the mouth to the stomach.
      The esophagus is lined with mucus, which is used as a lubricant. The
      esophagus uses a process called peristalsis to move the food.

    <app-explanation title="Stomach">
      The stomach is a pouch that contains stomach acid. This acid preforms
      chemical digestion, which further breaks down the food so it can be
      absorbed. The stomach is protected by a layer of mucus, so the acid
      doesn't burn through the sides.
    </app-explanation>
    <app-explanation title="Duodenum">
      The duodenum further breaks down the food, and starts absorbing the
      nutrients. The small intestine is linned with villi and microvilli. Theses
      are almost hair shaped, and increase the surface area to help with
      absorption.
    </app-explanation>
    <app-explanation title="Jejunum/Ileum">
      The jejunum is another part of the small intestine. The jejunum makes up a
      majority of the small intestines length, being around 6 meters in length.
      The jejunum does a similar thing as the duodenum, absorbing nutrients and
      further breaking down food. The jejunum also has villi along the insides.
